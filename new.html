Hello my name is nimeesh Sharma I am a sophomore at the West Windsor Plainsboro High School North, and Iâ€™m applying for the position of director. I joined my local Leo Club step for a better world Leo Club 3 years ago and became the website developer. my experience as the website developer and as the lead of many drives has forced me to become an effective communicator, collaborator, have good critical thinking skills, and have the ability to make meaninful relatinships (because i believe im an easy guy to talk to). Being in a Leo Club has also been a very fun time in my life whether it be attending ldun with my friends and learning about leadership qualities from renowned speakers or just having our weekly meetings and Recaps where I can talk and have fun.  some activities that I also believe Advance my skill set are my active participation in kung fu for example where I have learned a dedication and persistence, me tutoring elementary and middle schoolers to help them with computer science work and other homework which has taught me leadership, my participation in Boy Scouts that is taught me collaboration communication and to be prepared, the many drives ive led in my leo club, such as the canned food drives where we donated 1000+ cans to homefront, and got to directly witness the good they did. And some of the more difficult classes I take in school that have forced me to work hard and not be afraid of making mistakes. if I were to be elected as directorI would make it my priority to give back to the community which is one of the primary reasons why I joined a Leo Club in the first place, I would seek to advance the multiple district in as many ways as I possibly can, and I would work to strengthen Communications between the Leo clubsTo give back to the community as much as possible. to recap I believe I am fit for the role because of the experience I have gained not only from the Leo Club but also my extracurriculars in school activities . and as the saying goes when there's a need there's a leo so I hope you will elect me to be that lion to step up to any cause necessary thank you for your time.
